----------------------------------- Kubernetes---------------------------------------------

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that was initially designed by Google to help scale
containerized applications in the cloud. Kubernetes can manage the lifecycle of containers, creating and
destroying them depending on the needs of the application, as well as providing a host of other features.
Kubernetes has become one of the most discussed concepts in cloud-based application development,
and the rise of Kubernetes signals a shift in the way that applications are developed and deployed.
In general, Kubernetes is formed by a cluster of servers, called Nodes, each running Kubernetes agent
processes and communicating with one another. The Master Node contains a collection of processes
called the control plane that helps enact and maintain the desired state of the Kubernetes cluster, while
Worker Nodes are responsible for running the containers that form your applications and services.



## A Kubernetes cluster is composed of two separate planes:

Kubernetes control plane—manages Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them. Include components like the API Server, Scheduler, and Controller Manager.
Kubernetes Workernode that can run containerized workloads. Each node is managed by the kubelet, an agent that receives commands from the control plane. --

==============================================================
## Master Node or Control Node compomnents  ##


## API Server -------
Provides an API that serves as the front end of a Kubernetes control plane. It is responsible for handling external and internal requests—determining whether a request is valid and then processing it. The API can be accessed via the kubectl command-line interface or other tools like kubeadm, and via REST calls.

## Scheduler :------ 
This component is responsible for scheduling pods on specific nodes according to automated workflows and user defined conditions, which can include resource requests

## etcd :-----
A key-value database that contains data about your cluster state and configuration. Etcd is fault tolerant and distributed.

## Controller:-----
It receives information about the current state of the cluster and objects within it, and sends instructions to move the cluster towards the cluster operator’s desired state. 

====================================================================
## Worker Node Components ##

## kubelet: ----
Each node contains a kubelet, which is a small application that can communicate with the Kubernetes control plane. The kubelet is responsible for ensuring that containers specified in pod configuration are running on a specific node, and manages their lifecycle.. It executes the actions commanded by your control plane

## Kube Proxy :---
All compute nodes contain kube-proxy, a network proxy that facilitates Kubernetes networking services. It handles all network communications outside and inside the cluster, forwarding traffic or replying on the packet filtering layer of the operating system.

## Container Runtime Engine :---
Each node comes with a container runtime engine, which is responsible for running containers. Docker is a popular container runtime engine, but Kubernetes supports other runtimes that are compliant with Open Container Initiative, including CRI-O and rkt.

#Nodes: ----
Nodes are physical or virtual machines that can run pods as part of a Kubernetes cluster. A cluster can scale up to 5000 nodes. To scale a cluster’s capacity, you can add more nodes.

#POD:--------

Pods—pods are the smallest unit provided by Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads.  A pod typically includes several containers, which together form a functional unit or microservice.

What is Minikube?
Minikube is a tool that sets up a Kubernetes environment on a local PC or laptop
minikube quickly sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows. We proudly focus on helping application developers and new Kubernetes users.



What is Kubectl?

kubectl is the Kubernetes-specific command line tool that lets you communicate and control Kubernetes clusters. Whether you're creating, managing, or deleting resources on your Kubernetes platform, kubectl is an essential tool.

=============================================================
# EKS cluster Setup Process 

  # Create an IAM Role and attache it to EC2 instance    
   `Note: create IAM user with programmatic access if your bootstrap system is outside of AWS`   
   IAM user should have access to   
   IAM   
   EC2   
   VPC    
   CloudFormation

  # Create your cluster and nodes 
   ```sh
   eksctl create cluster --name cluster-name  \
   --region region-name \
   --node-type instance-type \
   --nodes-min 2 \
   --nodes-max 2 \ 
   --zones <AZ-1>,<AZ-2>
   
   example:
   eksctl create cluster --name naresh \
      --region ap-south-1 \
   --node-type t2.small \

# after create cluster to update it
 aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster name>


 # To delete the EKS clsuter 
    
   eksctl delete cluster naresh --region ap-south-1
